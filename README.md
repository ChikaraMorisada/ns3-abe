=======
This repository gives code examples of how to use Network Simulator NS-3.
It is intended to be used as "scratch" directory in ns-allinone-3.17/ns-3.17.
At this time, it is in rapid development and code is changed frequently.
Beause we don't have enough documentation, feel free to contact the authors.

Note that documentation is not matured.
